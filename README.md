This file is the Markdown file that teaches you about the instruction to run this file.
This file is best suited for Jupyter Notebook due to the `ipywidgets`, so we recommend
to run this in `Jupyter Notebook`, although this is in python script.

To run this project:
* Download the program file folder.
* Download the Python reading script program(again we recommend downloading `Jupyter Notebook`).
* Download the libraries that this program uses, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `ipywidgets`.
* Run the program through the `main.py` file.

_If you are using Jupyter Notebook:_
* Download the program file folder.
* Create `main.ipynb` file through Jupyter Notebook.
* Copy and paste the `functions.py` file first, and copy and paste the `main.py` file after, excluding import statements.
* Inside the `main` function, erase every `fo.`(not the whole function, just the fo.)
* Run the program to see the full visualization!
